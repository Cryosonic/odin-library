# odin-library
A project on using Javascript Objects.
This project demonstrates the ability to use classes and inheritance.
I have manipulated the prototype to include a new method after the constructor was declared.

Another exciting part of this project was the use of nexted selectors for the CSS stylesheet.
This makes the stylesheet easier to read and maintain as it follows the same flow and layout as the HTML document.
